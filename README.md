# ‚ö° Orbit ‚Äì Transformer Management System

Orbit is a web-based system designed to **digitize and streamline routine thermal inspections of distribution transformers**.
Currently, inspections are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. This project lays the foundation for an end-to-end inspection workflow.

---

## üìå Current Implementation (Phase 2)

We have completed **Phase 2 ‚Äì Automated Fault Detection & Inspection Comments**, which introduces AI-powered analysis and feedback management, enhancing the system‚Äôs intelligence and usability.

### üîç Roboflow AI Integration

Integrated Roboflow model trained on transformer thermal imagery.

On uploading a maintenance image, the backend automatically:

* Sends the image to the Roboflow API for inference
* Receives detected fault bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores
* Stores the prediction JSON in the database
* Annotated images are displayed in the inspection page

### üß† Fault Detection Workflow

Detected anomalies (e.g., hotspots, loose connections) are classified as:

* Normal
* Potential Fault
* Fault

The results are visually rendered on the uploaded image with color-coded bounding boxes.

### üí¨ Inspection Comment System

Inspectors can add comments and observations on each inspection.

Each comment includes:

* Author name
* Comment text
* Timestamp

Comments are stored in a dedicated table linked to the inspection.
Admins can view and manage all past discussions on a transformer‚Äôs inspection history.

## üóÇÔ∏è Previous Implementation (Phase 1)

**Phase 1 ‚Äì Transformer and Baseline Image Management** laid the foundation for managing transformers and baseline images.

### Admin Interface for Transformer Management

* Add new transformer records
* View and edit existing transformer records
* Delete transformer records if required

### Thermal Image Upload and Tagging

* Upload **thermal images** linked to specific transformers
* Support for two image types:

  * **Baseline**: Reference images for comparisons
  * **Maintenance**: Images from periodic inspections
* Each image is stored with metadata:

  * Upload date/time
  * Image type (Baseline / Maintenance)
  * Uploader (admin ID or name)

### Categorization by Environmental Conditions

* While uploading baseline images, users must select environmental conditions:

  * Sunny
  * Cloudy
  * Rainy
* Images are stored and searchable by these conditions

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)
* **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot (RESTful API)
* **Database**: Relational DB (PostgreSQL)

## üöÄ Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

* Java 21 (for Spring Boot backend) - [Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/apac/java/technologies/downloads/)
* Maven 3.9+ (build tool, usually bundled with IntelliJ / Spring Boot) - [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* Node.js (v18.x or higher is recommended) - [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
* npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)
* PostgreSQL 17 (database, use pgAdmin for management) - [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

---

### Frontend Setup (React + Vite + Tailwind)

1. Go to frontend folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Orbit-Transformer-Management/Transformer-Management
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open the app in browser: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### Database Setup

1. Create PostgreSQL database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE transformer_db;
```

2. Spring Boot will auto-generate tables (using JPA).

3. If needed, you can insert sample data manually via pgAdmin or SQL scripts.

### API Endpoints (Phase 1)

#### Transformer APIs

## üöß Known Limitations / Future Work

* User authentication/authorization not yet implemented (anyone can access endpoints).
* No user profile or role management is available.
* The Roboflow AI model cannot be retrained dynamically using user inputs or feedback.
* Fault detection results rely solely on the pre-trained model without continuous learning capability.
