# ⚡ Orbit – Transformer Management System

Orbit is a web-based system designed to **digitize and streamline routine thermal inspections of distribution transformers**. This project lays the foundation for an end-to-end inspection workflow where it integrates a detection pipeline with an interactive annotation and feedback loop, allowing users to adjust detections directly through the interface. Corrected annotations are logged and later used to fine-tune the model automatically, enabling continuous performance improvement and adaptability to real-world data.

## 🗂️ Phase 1 – Transformer and Baseline Image Management

Phase 1 laid the foundation for managing transformers and baseline images.

### Admin Interface for Transformer Management

* Add new transformer records
* View and edit existing transformer records
* Delete transformer records if required

### Thermal Image Upload and Tagging

* Upload **thermal images** linked to specific transformers
* Support for two image types:

  * **Baseline**: Reference images for comparisons
  * **Maintenance**: Images from periodic inspections
* Each image is stored with metadata:

  * Upload date/time
  * Image type (Baseline / Maintenance)
  * Uploader (admin ID or name)

### Categorization by Environmental Conditions

* While uploading baseline images, users must select environmental conditions:

  * Sunny
  * Cloudy
  * Rainy
* Images are stored and searchable by these conditions.

## 📌 Phase 2 – Automated Fault Detection & Inspection Comments

In phase 2 we introduced AI-powered analysis and feedback management, enhancing the system’s intelligence and usability.

### 🔍 Roboflow AI Integration

Integrated Roboflow model trained on transformer thermal imagery.

On uploading a maintenance image, the backend automatically:

* Sends the image to the Roboflow API for inference
* Receives detected fault bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores
* Stores the prediction JSON in the database
* Annotated images are displayed in the inspection page

### 🧠 Fault Detection Workflow

Detected anomalies (e.g., hotspots, loose connections) are classified as:

* Normal
* Potential Fault
* Fault

The results are visually rendered on the uploaded image with color-coded bounding boxes.

### 💬 Inspection Comment System

Inspectors can add comments and observations on each inspection. Each comment includes:

* Author name
* Comment text
* Timestamp

Comments are stored in a dedicated table linked to the inspection. Admins can view and manage all past discussions on a transformer’s inspection history.

## ⚙️ Phase 3 – Interactive Annotation & Feedback Loop

We have completed phase 3 focusing on enhancing user control, data accuracy, and model improvement.

### 🖊️ Interactive Annotation Tools

On the anomaly detection view, inspectors can now directly interact with the AI-detected anomalies by:

* Adjusting existing anomaly markers (resize, reposition)
* Deleting incorrect detections
* Adding new anomaly markers by drawing bounding boxes

Each annotation captures:

* Annotation type (added / edited / deleted)  
* Optional comments or notes  
* Timestamp and user ID  

This feature empowers users to refine detections and ensure high-quality inspection records.

### 🗃️ Metadata and Annotation Persistence

All annotation changes are automatically captured and saved in the backend.  
Each record includes:

* Annotation ID  
* Detection ID
* Inspection number
* Annotations type
* User
* Comment
* Timestamp   

When the same image is revisited, existing annotations are automatically reloaded, maintaining a consistent inspection history.

### 🔁 Feedback Integration for Model Improvement

The system now facilitates the automatic collection of high-quality training data, enabling continuous model retraining (Finetuning).

- Feedback Log Generation: A service endpoint allows for the export of a structured JSON log containing:
   - The Final Human-Validated Annotations
   - Annotator metadata

- Automated Retraining Readiness: This exportable log can be formatted for direct ingestion to Roboflow, setting up the automated finetuning of the model when enough new, corrected data is accumulated.

## 📄 Phase 4 – Digital Maintenance Record Generation

We have completed Phase 4, focusing on the digitization of the final output: replacing handwritten logbooks with automated, traceable reports.

### 🖨️ Automated Report Generation

The system now automatically generates professional maintenance records based on the inspection data.
* **Auto-Population**: Instantly pulls Transformer Metadata (ID, Location, Capacity), Inspection Timestamp, and the Annotated Thermal Image from previous phases.
* **Visual Evidence**: Embeds the processed thermal image with verified anomaly markers directly into the report.
* **History Integration**: Automatically lists "Related Inspections" on the report, providing immediate context on the transformer's health history.

### ✍️ Engineer Validation & Input

While AI provides the data, the site engineer provides the judgment. The report interface includes editable fields for:
* **Inspector Details**: Name and signature placeholders.
* **Electrical Readings**: Input fields for Voltage (V) and Current (A).
* **Status Classification**: Dropdown selection (OK / Needs Maintenance / Urgent Attention).
* **Actionable Outcomes**: Fields for "Recommended Action" and "Additional Remarks."

### 📜 Record Persistence & Retrieval

* **Digital Archiving**: Completed reports are saved to the database, creating a permanent audit trail.
* **History Viewer**: Users can view a timeline of all past maintenance records for any specific transformer.
* **PDF Export**: The final output is formatted for clean printing or PDF export for official filing.

## 🚧 Known Limitations / Future Work

* User authentication/authorization not yet implemented (anyone can access endpoints).
* No user profile or role management is available.
* The Roboflow AI model cannot be retrained dynamically using user inputs or feedback.
* Fault detection results rely solely on the pre-trained model without continuous learning capability.
