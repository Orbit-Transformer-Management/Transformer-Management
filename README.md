# ‚ö° Orbit ‚Äì Transformer Management System

Orbit is a web-based system designed to **digitize and streamline routine thermal inspections of distribution transformers**. Currently, inspections are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. This project lays the foundation for an end-to-end inspection workflow.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 3 ‚Äì Interactive Annotation & Feedback Loop

We have completed phase 3 focusing on enhancing user control, data accuracy, and model improvement.

### üñäÔ∏è Interactive Annotation Tools

On the anomaly detection view, inspectors can now directly interact with the AI-detected anomalies by:

* Adjusting existing anomaly markers (resize, reposition)
* Deleting incorrect detections
* Adding new anomaly markers by drawing bounding boxes

Each annotation captures:

* Annotation type (added / edited / deleted)  
* Optional comments or notes  
* Timestamp and user ID  

This feature empowers users to refine detections and ensure high-quality inspection records.

### üóÉÔ∏è Metadata and Annotation Persistence

All annotation changes are automatically captured and saved in the backend.  
Each record includes:

* User ID  
* Timestamp  
* Image ID  
* Transformer ID  
* Action taken  

When the same image is revisited, existing annotations are automatically reloaded, maintaining a consistent inspection history.

### üîÅ Feedback Integration for Model Improvement

The system now facilitates the automatic collection of high-quality training data, enabling continuous model retraining (Finetuning).

- Feedback Log Generation: A service endpoint allows for the export of a structured JSON log containing:
   - The Final Human-Validated Annotations
   - Annotator metadata

- Automated Retraining Readiness: This exportable log can be formatted for direct ingestion to Roboflow, setting up the automated finetuning of the model when enough new, corrected data is accumulated.

## üìå Phase 2 ‚Äì Automated Fault Detection & Inspection Comments

In phase 2 we introduced AI-powered analysis and feedback management, enhancing the system‚Äôs intelligence and usability.

### üîç Roboflow AI Integration

Integrated Roboflow model trained on transformer thermal imagery.

On uploading a maintenance image, the backend automatically:

* Sends the image to the Roboflow API for inference
* Receives detected fault bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores
* Stores the prediction JSON in the database
* Annotated images are displayed in the inspection page

### üß† Fault Detection Workflow

Detected anomalies (e.g., hotspots, loose connections) are classified as:

* Normal
* Potential Fault
* Fault

The results are visually rendered on the uploaded image with color-coded bounding boxes.

### üí¨ Inspection Comment System

Inspectors can add comments and observations on each inspection. Each comment includes:

* Author name
* Comment text
* Timestamp

Comments are stored in a dedicated table linked to the inspection. Admins can view and manage all past discussions on a transformer‚Äôs inspection history.

## üóÇÔ∏è Phase 1 ‚Äì Transformer and Baseline Image Management

Phase 1 laid the foundation for managing transformers and baseline images.

### Admin Interface for Transformer Management

* Add new transformer records
* View and edit existing transformer records
* Delete transformer records if required

### Thermal Image Upload and Tagging

* Upload **thermal images** linked to specific transformers
* Support for two image types:

  * **Baseline**: Reference images for comparisons
  * **Maintenance**: Images from periodic inspections
* Each image is stored with metadata:

  * Upload date/time
  * Image type (Baseline / Maintenance)
  * Uploader (admin ID or name)

### Categorization by Environmental Conditions

* While uploading baseline images, users must select environmental conditions:

  * Sunny
  * Cloudy
  * Rainy
* Images are stored and searchable by these conditions.

cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run development server:

## üöß Known Limitations / Future Work

* User authentication/authorization not yet implemented (anyone can access endpoints).
* No user profile or role management is available.
* The Roboflow AI model cannot be retrained dynamically using user inputs or feedback.
* Fault detection results rely solely on the pre-trained model without continuous learning capability.
